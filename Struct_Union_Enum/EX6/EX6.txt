#include<stdio.h>
union job{
char name[32];
float salary;
int worker_no;
}u;
struct job1{
	char name[32];
	float salary;
	int worker_no;
}s;
int main(){
	printf("Size of union=%d\n",sizeof(u));
	printf("Size of structure=%d\n",sizeof(s));
	return 0;
}

***********solution**********
the output of this program
size of union will be 32 Bytes -> which is the biggest size of data type (char)
size of structure will be 40 Bytes -> which came from 32 Bytes (char) + 4 Bytes (float) + 4 Bytes (int) assuming no padding
